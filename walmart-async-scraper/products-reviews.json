    "description": "Pretty solid monitor for the price, it did its job for a meager $113. There are minor problems, but it was not game changing at all (no sound system, screen went black momentarily randomly). \n\nThe only unfortunate problem I had with this product was that the screen broke very easily. No I did not punch it. I recommend you don't put any weight on it whatsoever. I don't think it came with a warranty so I am at a loss of $113",
